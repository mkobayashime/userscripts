# Userscripts/styles

Userscripts/styles made by mkobayashime.

All of them are written just for myself, so I bear no responsibility.

Inspired by [hideo54/userscripts](https://github.com/hideo54/userscripts).

## Recommended operation environment

- Google Chrome
- [Tampermonkey](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo) (for `.user.js`)
- [Stylus](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/stylus/clngdbkpkpeebahjckkjfobafhncgmne) (for `.user.css`)

## Usage

Click _Raw_ button in the desired script/style. Tampermonkey/Stylus will open their installation page automatically.
